# Ur LUT visualizer
 
Welcome!

Here is the code for the Ur Lut visualizer (finkel ruleset for now).

If you want to run this locally, first install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

Then, to install dependencies: `poetry install`

Then you can spawn a shell in the poetry virtualenv using `poetry shell`

Once in the virtualenv, run `python dashapp.py` and the server will be running on http://127.0.0.1:8050

Enjoy!
